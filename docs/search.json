To maintain an engaged and collaborative learning environment, a minimum attendance rate of \\(80\\%\\) is compulsory. Attendance will be recorded during each class session, and weekly updates on attendance percentages will be posted on the course platform for your reference. If we find that your attendance percentage falls below the required threshold due to extenuating circumstances, you must seek approval from your academic advisor. This approval is mandatory for participation in any examinations, including assignments. It is essential to communicate proactively with your advisor to discuss the reasons for any attendance issues and to devise a plan for catching up on missed coursework. Please note that exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with a strong emphasis on maintaining the integrity of the learning experience for all students."
